# GliaCounter
A program design to count and classify neural glia cells

## TO-DO
Look for Napari Plugins for Deep Learning model training
  Model does not need to be segmentation based as all we need is a cell count
  Can switch to segmentation later of the glia cells
  Using segmentation data we can generate an activation estimate of the cell
